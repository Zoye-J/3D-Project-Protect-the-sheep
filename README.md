# 3D-Project-Protect-the-sheep
A 3D OpenGL game where a Shepherd protects his sheep from wolves.
The game is simple.
Shepherd will chop wood in the day time while pulling his sheep when they get stuck.
And at night time he will collect wood to keep the fire going while protecting his sheep from Wolves.
Remember He loses sheep numbers if they aren't pulled out in time and when wolves take them. The Shepherd loses heart point if he let's the fire burn out!
